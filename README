**This library is currently being cleaned up for public consumption, at the moment
it is not very usable.**

wordsalad
---------

A small Python module for generating non-sense texts from a source text.

It generates a Markov chain after tokenising the input, picking a path at random
and concatenating the visited words.

## Dependencies

- numpy (used for the nice sparse matrices it provides)
- flask (for a planned standalone web interface)
